# INTRODUCTION

MyDB is a PHP script you can use to do basic database operations.
These operations include, but not limited to, doing CRUD operations on tables.


# INSTALLATION

**Minimum requirements**
PHP 5.3 or later
MySQL database

- How to
Copy all the files in the inc folder into your working directory.
To do CRUD operations, include (or require) at least the mydb.php and mydb_table.php files

```php
	require 'inc/mydb.php';
	require 'inc/mydb_table.php';
```

You can optionally set some default connection values by defining them in the mydb constants

```php
	define( 'MyDB_HOST', 'localhost' );
	define( 'MyDB_USERNAME', 'the_cool_admin' );
	define( 'MyDB_PASSWORD', 'Z3cur&_p@$$W0RD' );
	define( 'MyDB_DATABASE', 'my_database' );
```


# USAGE

**Example 1: Getting table rows**

```php
	$con = new mydb();
	$table = new mydb_table( $con, 'all_cars' ); // assuming 'all_cars' is your table name
	$table = $table->get();    // returns an associative array
```
	
**Example 2: Adding a table row**

```php
	$con = new mydb();    // assuming you defined those constants
	$table = new mydb_table( $con, 'all_cars' );
	$table->add( array( 'manufacturer' => 'toyota', 'model' => 'Corolla' => 'Year' => 2017 .... ) );
```
	
**Example 3: Updating a table row**

```php
	$con = new mydb();
	$table = new mydb_table( $con, 'all_cars' );
	$table->update( array( 'id' => 100021', 'model' => 'Yaris', 'Year' => 2016 ... ) ); // Method 1
	$table->where( array( 'id' => 100021' ) )->update( array( 'model' => 'Yaris', 'Year' => 2016 ... ) ); // Method 2
```
	
	Method 1 & Method 2 do the same thing. 
	Please note: if table has primary key(s), they are required
	
**Example 4: Deleting a table row**

```php
	$con = new mydb();
	$table = new mydb_table( $con, 'all_cars' );
	$table->delete( array( 'id' => 100021' ) ); // Method 1
	$table->where( array( 'id' => 100021' ) )->delete(); // Method 2
```
	
	Method 1 & Method 2 do the same thing. 
	Please note: if table has primary key(s), they are required
	
**Note:**
All CRUD operations except Read ( table->get() ) will return boolean values based on affected rows.
table->get() will return an empty array if no rows found
